<h2>Vign&egrave;re</h2>

The idea behind the Vigen&egrave;re cipher, like all polyalphabetic ciphers, is to
disguise plaintext letter frequencies, which interferes with a straightforward
application of frequency analysis. For instance, if P is the most frequent
letter in a ciphertext whose plaintext is in English,
one might suspect that P corresponds to E, because E is the most frequently
used letter in English. However, using the Vigen&egrave;re
cipher, E can be enciphered as different ciphertext
letters at different points in the message, thus defeating simple frequency
analysis. The primary weakness of the Vigen&egrave;re
cipher is the repeating nature of its key. If a cryptanalyst correctly guesses
the key's length, then the cipher text can be treated as interwoven Caesar
ciphers, which individually are easily broken. The Kasiski
and Friedman tests can help determine the key length.

<h2>Kasiski examination</h2>

For more details on this topic, see Kasiski examination. In 1863 Friedrich Kasiski
was the first to publish a successful general attack on the Vigen&egrave;re
cipher. Earlier attacks relied on knowledge of the plaintext, or use of a
recognizable word as a key. Kasiski's method had no
such dependencies. Kasiski was the first to publish
an account of the attack, but it is clear that there were others who were aware
of it. In 1854, Charles Babbage was goaded into breaking the 
Vigen&egrave;re cipher when John Hall Brock Thwaites
submitted a &quot;new&quot; cipher to the Journal of the Society of the Arts.
When Babbage showed that Thwaites' cipher was
essentially just another recreation of the Vigen&egrave;re
cipher, Thwaites challenged Babbage to break his
cipher encoded twice, with keys of different length. Babbage succeeded in
decrypting a sample, which turned out to be the poem &quot;The Vision of
Sin&quot;, by Alfred Tennyson, encrypted according to the keyword
&quot;Emily&quot;, the first name of Tennyson's wife. Babbage never explained
the method he used. Studies of Babbage's notes reveal that he had used the
method later published by Kasiski, and suggest that
he had been using the method as early as 1846. The Kasiski
examination, also called the Kasiski test, takes
advantage of the fact that repeated words may, by chance, sometimes be
encrypted using the same key letters, leading to repeated groups in the ciphertext.

For example, Consider the following encryption using
the keyword ABCD:
<br>
<br>
Key: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ABCDABCDABCDABCDABCDABCDABCD 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRYPTOISSHORTFORCRYPTOGRAPHY
<br>
Ciphertext: CSASTPKVSIQUTGQUCSASTPIUAQJB
<br><br>

There is an easily seen repetition in the ciphertext, and the Kasiski test
will be effective. Here the distance between the repetitions of CSASTP is 16.
Assuming that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, this
implies that the key is 16, 8, 4, 2, or 1 characters long. (All factors of the
distance are possible key lengths a key of length one is just a simple caesar cipher, where cryptanalysis is much easier.) Since
key lengths 2 and 1 are unrealistically short, one only needs to try lengths 
16, 8, or 4. Longer messages make the test more accurate because they usually
contain more repeated ciphertext segments. The
following ciphertext has two segments that are
repeated: 
<br><br>
Ciphertext:VHVSSPQUCEMRVBVBBBVHVSURQGIBDUGRNICJQUCERVUAXSSR
<br><br>
The distance between the repetitions of VHVS is 18.
Assuming that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, this
implies that the key is 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. The distance
between the repetitions of QUCE is 30 characters. This means that the key
length could be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. By taking the
intersection of these sets one could safely conclude that the most likely key
length is 6, since 3, 2, and 1 are unrealistically short.

<h2>Frequency analysis<o:p></o:p></h2>

Once the length of the key is known, the
ciphertext can be rewritten into that many columns, with each
column corresponding to a single letter of the key. Each column consists of
plaintext that has been encrypted by a single Caesar cipher; the Caesar key
(shift) is just the letter of the Vigen&egrave;re key that
was used for that column. Using methods similar to those used to break the
Caesar cipher, the letters in the ciphertext can be
discovered. An improvement to the Kasiski
examination, known as Kerckhoffs' method, matches
each column's letter frequencies to shifted plaintext frequencies to discover
the key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in the key is
known, the cryptanalyst can simply decrypt the ciphertext
and reveal the plaintext. Kerckhoffs' method is not
applicable when the Vigen&egrave;re table has been
scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, although Kasiski examination and coincidence tests can still be used
to determine key length in that case. 

<h2>Key elimination</h2>

The Vigen&egrave;re cipher
function is essentially modulo arithmetic, and thus commutative. So if the key
length is known (or guessed) then subtracting the cipher text from itself,
offset by the key length will produce the cipher text encrypted with itself. If
any words in the cipher text are known or can be guessed, then the plain text
and also the key, will be revealed. This is useful if the key is an obscure
sequence of letters because the plain text will generally be ordinary words.
Key elimination is useful for making short versions of the plain text.
