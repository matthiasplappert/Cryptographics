<h2>Historical Background</h2>
<p>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, 
is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher
in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
The method is named after Julius Gajus Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.</p>

<p>The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, 
such as the Vigen&egrave;re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. 
As with all single alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken
and in modern practice offers essentially no communication security.</p>

<h2>Similar Ciphers</h2> 
<p>The cipher of Vigen&egrave;re that was mentioned before is visualized further in this program. If you move on to the next visualization you can learn and try it yourself.</p>

<p>The ROT13 cipher is quiet interesting because of its presence in the modern world. For example Windows XP used it for encrypting its
registry entries. The funny thing is that ROT13 is a normal Caesar cipher with a key of 13. Therefore easily crackable.</p>
